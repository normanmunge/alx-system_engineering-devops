## Alx-system_engineering-devops

----------------------------------

This repository contains directories that show some basic Linux Commands used in dev-ops  as well as Commands to add users, groups and give them Permissions:

*List **0x00-shell_basics** directory - contains some tasks recommended from Holberton University that enable devop engineers to use Unix based commands in a shell environment
*List **0x01-shell_permissions** directory - contains some tasks that adds users and groups and gives them permissions

*  There are definitely more to commands - go do your research :-) *
